# PIG-GAME
This is a simple console-based dice game called "Pig", designed for 2 to 4 players. It uses random dice rolls and basic player turn mechanics to simulate the classic "Pig" game rules.
 How the Game Works:
The game supports 2 to 4 players.

Each player takes turns rolling a die (1â€“6).

During a turn:

If a player rolls anything but 1, they can choose to roll again or hold (end their turn and add the score).

If they roll a 1, their current turn score resets to 0, and their turn ends immediately.

Players accumulate their scores over multiple turns.

The first player to reach or exceed 100 points wins the game.
