🐷 Pig Dice Game (Python)
A simple, fun, console-based dice game for 2–4 players, inspired by the classic Pig game. Players take turns rolling a die, aiming to reach the winning score without hitting the unlucky 1!

🎮 Game Rules
Supports 2 to 4 players.

On each turn, a player rolls a die as many times as they like.

Rolling a 1 ends the player's turn and resets their turn score to 0.

Rolling 2–6 adds that number to the turn score.

Players can choose to "hold" to bank their turn score into their total.

First player to reach 100 points wins the game!
